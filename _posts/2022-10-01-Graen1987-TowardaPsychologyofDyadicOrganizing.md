Graen, G. B., & Scandura, T. A. (1987). Toward a psychology of dyadic organizing. Research in organizational behavior.

## Summary
In an organization, a dyad (relationship between two people) can be vertical, horizontal, or diagonal.  Within dyads, cooperation exists as a series of inducements (e.g., pay) and contributions (e.g., work).  A specific behavior of one person is contingent on the specific behavior of another person.  These relationships are called _interacts_.  The actions of a first person might trigger specific actions in a second person, which causes action in a third person – this is called a _double interact_.  Double interacts describe interpersonal influence.  Organizations are formed by these interlocked, dyadic, behavioral cycles.  Dyadic organizing usually follows a cycle that includes _role taking, role making, and role routinization._

In *role taking*, a role (an unstructured task) is offered by a superior to a person.  In return, the person counteroffers and this continues until an equilibrium is reached.  Once the role is accepted, *role making* occurs.  In this, the role will continue to develop organically.  Managers have several different resources that they can offer in exchange for role: information, influence, tasks, latitude, support, and attention.  Once role stasis is reached, *role routinization* takes place.  It is during this phase that “trust, respect, loyalty, liking, intimacy, support, openness, and honesty” develop strongly.

## Application
Highlights the central position of social dyads in all organizations.  Managing is essentially a series of one-one-one relationships.  The list of informal (e.g., not pay) managerial resources is useful for negotiations.
