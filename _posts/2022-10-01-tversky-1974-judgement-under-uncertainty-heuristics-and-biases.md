Tversky, A., & Kahneman, D. (1974). Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases: Biases in judgments reveal some heuristics of thinking under uncertainty. science, 185(4157), 1124-1131.

## Summary
While this paper refers to both _representativeness_ and _availability_, these are treated elsewhere in more depth (respectively [here](todo:insert representativeness link) and [here](todo:insert availability link)).  A new heuristic is introduced in this paper - **anchoring**.  When making estimates, people generally start from an initial value, whether reached through suggestion or through computation, and then adjust from it.  This initial value is known as an _anchor_.  Anchors are especially sticky cognitively.  For example, an experiment was run asking participants the percentage of African countries in the UN.  An anchor was provided by a spinning wheel of fortune, and made salient by asking if their guess was higher or lower than the random number.  The manipulation pronounced a significant result - “the median estimates of the percentage of African countries in the United Nations were 25 and 45 for groups that received 10 and 65, respectively, as starting points [anchors.”  The stickiness generally results in insufficient adjustment from the anchor.  In this paper, anchoring is generally conceptualized as a quantitative phenomenon in response to numerical stimuli.

## Application
This would be a good paper to assign to a class to introduce them to these 3 heuristics.  Anchoring has important application to negotiations.  For future research, it would be interesting to look into the relationship between _priming_ and anchoring?  Priming seems to not replicate well, while anchoring seems fairly robust.
