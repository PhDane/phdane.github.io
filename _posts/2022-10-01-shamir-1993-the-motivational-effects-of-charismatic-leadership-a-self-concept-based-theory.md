Shamir, B., House, R. J., & Arthur, M. B. (1993). The motivational effects of charismatic leadership: A self-concept based theory. Organization science, 4(4), 577-594.

## Summary
**Charismatic leadership** (also called “transformational,” “visionary,” or “inspirational”) is a leadership theory that deals with leaders who are able to motivate their team members to adopt a collectivist mindset (i.e., the preferred mindset of the organization).  These charismatic leaders accomplish this using five techniques.  The first motivation technique is “_increasing the intrinsic valence of effort_.”  This means that the leaders attach a moral aspect to effort.  This facilitates the employee's attachment of effort to their self-identity.  The second technique that charismatic leaders use is “_increasing effort-accomplishment expectancies_.”  They do this by communicating high expectations and confidence in the employees’ ability to meet those expectations, many times by emphasizing “collective efficacy.”  The third method used is “_increasing the intrinsic valence of goal accomplishment_.”  This is accomplished by tying goal importance to group identity.  The fourth technique is “_instilling faith in a better future_.”  Charismatic leaders focus on ephemeral, future goals (as opposed to “proximal, specific goals”).  This technique also includes “de-emphasiz[ing] intrinsic rewards,” which allows employees to construct internal reasons (todo: link to Festinger “forced compliance” paper).  The final motivational method used is “_creating personal commitment_.”  This happens when a relationship, role, or goal is integrated into the employee’s self-concept.  Together, these techniques emphasize (and de-emphasize) certain values within a follower’s self-concept.  These techniques are accomplished through _role modeling_ and _framing_ (also see Proposition 1).

In the followers, the transformation of the self-concept happens through _personal identification_, _social identification_, and _value internalization_.  Personal identification happens when followers want to be like their leader.  Social identification deals with the organization of the group becoming a more important part of the individual’s self-concept.  These processes can only occur if the values and identities that the leader seeks to instill are already part of the individual’s self-concept.  Instead of planting new values, the leader instead raises the salience of these pre-existing values and links them to goals and behaviors.

## Application
I’ve been told several times that leadership studies are a dying field, but this theoretical paper still seems to have some application, especially for managers looking to motivate.  Two more notes - charismatic leaders can be good (“Gandhi”) or bad (“Hitler”).  There are some organizational elements that are more likely to be present when charismatic leadership is also present: performance goals aren’t defined or are difficult to measure, the situation has some moral element (e.g., unlikely to emerge in tobacco production), high levels of uncertainty or “exceptional conditions.”

_PROPOSITION 1_. In order to implicate the followers' self-concepts, compared to noncharismatic leaders, the deliberate and nondeliberate messages of charismatic leaders will contain:
(a) more references to values and moral justifications,
(b) more references to the collective and to collective identity,
(c) more references to history,
(d) more positive references to followers' worth and as individuals and as a efficacy collective,
(e) more expressions of high expectations from followers,
(f) more references to distal goals and less reference to proximal goals.

_PROPOSITION 2_. The more leaders exhibit the behaviors specified above, the more their followers will have:
(a) a high salience of the collective identity in their self-concept,
(b) a sense of consistency between their self-concept and their actions on behalf of the leader and the collective.
(c) a high level of self-esteem and self-worth.
(d) a similarity between their self-concept and their perception of the leader.
(e) a high sense of collective efficacy.

_PROPOSITION 3_. The more leaders exhibit the behaviors specified in the theory the more  followers will demonstrate:
(a) personal commitment to the leader and the mission,
(b) a willingness to make sacrifices for the collective mission,
(c) organizational citizenship behavior,
(d) meaningfulness in their work and lives.

_PROPOSITION 4_. A necessary condition for a leader's messages to have charismatic effects is that the message is congruent with the existing values and identities held by potential followers.

_PROPOSITION 5_. The more the potential followers have an expressive orientation toward work and life, the more susceptible they will be to the influence of charismatic leaders.

_PROPOSITION 6_. The more the potential followers have a principled orientation to social relations, the more susceptible they will be to the influence of charismatic leaders.

_PROPOSITION 7_. The emergence and effectiveness of charismatic leaders will be facilitated to the extent to which:
(a) There is an opportunity for substantial moral involvement on the part of the leader and the followers,
(b) Performance goals cannot be easily specified and measured,
(c) Extrinsic rewards cannot be made clearly contingent on individual performance,
(d) There are few situational cues, constraints and reinforcers to guide behavior and provide incentives for specific performance,
(e) Exceptional effort, behavior and sacrifices are required of both the leaders and followers.
