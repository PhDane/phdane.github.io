## Summary
Theory building from cases is a method used by a number of highly cited papers (examples are cited).  Theory can be built from one or more cases.  Case studies usually include a large variety of data and can act as a bridge from “rich qualitative evidence to mainstream deductive research.”  If looking to extend existing theory, the research must be placed within extant literature.  For phenomenon-driven research, the research question must be significant and unanswered (if it were already answered, a _deductive_ rather than inductive approach might be more appropriate [todo:insert link]).  These are usually “how” and “why” questions, as opposed to “how many” and “how often.”

Regarding the generalizability of the theory, it is important that “the purpose of the research is to develop theory, not to test it.”  This approach allows for theoretical sampling, or selecting particularly interesting or illustrative cases.  These can include extreme examples or opportunities involving unusual access.  Single-case studies can be valid, but multiple-case studies are more generalizable.  Looking at polar cases can reveal patterns that might not be noticed from a single case.

One primary method of data collection is through interviews.  Collecting data from a variety of perspectives helps to both minimize subjectivity and “retrospective sensemaking.”  Data might include both a past case and a current case.  Theory can be developed and presented piece by piece.  “Construct tables” are particularly useful in summarizing focal constructs.  Theory should be both written and visually presented through a diagram.

## Application
Of limited use to practitioners, this paper would be very useful to PhD students.  It provides a very concise summary of this case research and provides an elegant formula for a resulting theoretical paper.
