Dweck, C. S. (1986). Motivational processes affecting learning. American psychologist, 41(10), 1040.

## Summary
**Learning goals** focus on growth and competence, while **performance goals** focus on achievement and negativity avoidance.  Adaptive patterns of achievement behavior are mastery focused (“characterized by challenge seeking and high, effective persistence in the face of obstacles”).  Maladaptive patterns of achievement include low levels of persistence when faced with obstacles and challenge avoidance.  Learning goals, adaptive patterns of achievement, and what is later referred to as a **growth mindset** are associated; while performance goals, maladaptive patterns of achievement, and a **fixed mindset** are related to each other.

Competition induces performance goals, as do spectators or evaluation.  Framing a task as a test (instead of as a game) also induces performance goals.  Students with growth mindsets, who are focused on learning goals, are more likely to engage in challenging subject material, whereas those focused on performance goals are more likely to avoid challenging material.  In a fixed mindset, difficulties or failures are attributed to a lack of ability.  Growth mindsets promote analysis and varying strategies when encountering difficulty.  This theory is illustrated convincingly through the use of research regarding sex differences in math learning.

## Application
Recognize that failure is part of the learning process.  If it is expected, it will most likely be less impactful.  When managing, be aware that competition can backfire.  Instead, work individually with employees on learning goals.
