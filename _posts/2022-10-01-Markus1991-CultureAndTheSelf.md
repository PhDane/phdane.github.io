## Summary
An _independent construal_ of self predominates Western culture.  It reflects the beliefs that people are separate and independent, a single person is a whole, and is generally inwardly focused.  In contrast, an _interdependent construal_ predominates other cultures.  Interdependent construal focus on the “fundamental _connectedness_ of human beings to each other.”  An individual is thought of, and fully realized, as a part of a greater social unit.  Individuals with a construal focus are generally focused outwards on others.

Many psychological concepts regarding the self are built around the idea of independent construal (e.g., self-fulfillment, self-consciousness, self-control).  These concepts may mean something completely different to those with an interdependent construal.  The Western idea of self-control is focused on inner attributes, while a more interdependent idea of self-control involves adjusting oneself to those who are part of one’s social unit.  The Western conception of self-esteem involves validation of one’s internal attributes.  The interdependent conception of self-esteem revolves around one’s ability to adjust and maintain harmony.

## Application
The generalizability of certain psychological constructs may not cross cultural boundaries and  requires additional cultural validation before application in a different culture.  In a similar vein, managing those with interdependent construals will require different strategies than managing those with independent construals because they each have unique motivations.  Ego-focused emotions might be appropriate in a Western context, but might be highly offensive in an interdependent context.
