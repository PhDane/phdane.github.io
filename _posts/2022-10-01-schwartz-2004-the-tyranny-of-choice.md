Schwartz, B. (2004). The tyranny of choice. Scientific American, 290(4), 70-75.

## Summary
This article relates the theory that too much choice leads to unhappiness.  A **maximizer** is a person who always tries to make the best choice possible.  A **satisficer** is a person who settles for a decision that is “good enough” (satisficing comes from [Herbert Simon](todo:insert link).  The author developed the Maximization Scale, measuring the propensity of people to maximize, and a proneness to regret scale.  High maximizers tended to also have high regret.  Maximizers are less happy than satisficers and more prone to depression.

## Application
Helpful advice for maximizers… When making an unimportant decision, restrict your choice options.  Learn to settle for “good enough” rather than the best.  Once you’ve made a decision, stop comparing it against other alternative choices.  Keep expectations low.  This theory also has repercussions regarding choice overload.
