Ibarra, H. (1999). Provisional selves: Experimenting with image and identity in professional adaptation. Administrative science quarterly, 44(4), 764-791.

I think this is an especially well-written and well-researched paper, but sometimes I struggle with assessing theoretical contributions.  In a certain light, this is just a specific application of a very general adaptation process.  Quite literally - gather information (observation), trial (experiment) and error (evaluation).

## Summary
Adaptation is the process that occurs when an individual attempts to improve the fit between themselves (internal) and their environment (external).  This involves changing either the internal or the external.  Professional identity, how people define themselves in a specific professional role, adapts with career progression.  _Provisional selves_, possible future versions of oneself, are “tried on” and evaluated for fit.  This process happens through three main tasks: observing, experimenting, and evaluating.

**Observation**, especially upwards observation of possible role models, allows an individual to bank resources (“tacit knowledge, attitudes, routines, impression management techniques”) that aid in the adaptation.  Through _role prototyping_, individuals are able to evaluate the role performance of others, selecting for credibility.  _Identity matching_ involves evaluating one’s values and attributes and selecting role models based on aspirational similarity (or future “fit”).  Upon identifying a role model, individuals begin **experimenting with provisional selves**.  This is accomplished most commonly through _imitation_, while the second most popular method was through employing “true-to-self strategies,” which were concerned with authenticity.  Finally, **provisional selves were evaluated** using both _internal_ and _external_ evaluations, both of which are positively and negatively valenced.  _Feedback_ is specifically related to external evaluations.

## Application
In training, it is important to provide exposure to individuals who model desired traits and behaviors.  Control over socialization can be exerted by making role model selection explicit.  New hires should be allowed time for socialization (and adaptation) before accurate assessments can be made.
