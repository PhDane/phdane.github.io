This paper is an interesting example of “you thought it was one thing, but actually it’s many things.”

## Summary
Information from 52 organizations, regarding five structural variables, was subjected to factor analysis, revealing three dimensions: _structured vs unstructured activities_, _concentrated vs dispersed authority_, and _line control vs impersonal control of workflow_.  These three dimensions were used to elaborate a taxonomy of bureaucracy, which were also revealed visually as clusters.  Since most of my factor analysis experience revolves around psychological scales, this was a novel use case for me.  It might be fruitful to treat seemingly unitary constructs to factor analysis to determine if there are patterns of covariance, which would suggest multiple dimensions.  I imagine that more modern clustering recognition algorithms could be used for more precise results, especially in analysis of more than three dimensions.

Highly structured organizations with low concentrations of authority are called _workflow bureaucracies_.  Examples include large manufacturers.  Organizations with high concentration of authority and low structure of activities are called _personnel bureaucracies_.  In these, the daily work is not bureaucratized, but everything related to employment is.  Examples include central government departments.  Organizations that are low on both structure and authority concentration are called _implicity structured organizations_.  These tend to be small organizations, run by an owner operator.  Though quite rare, a _full bureaucracy_ is one in which both structure and authority concentration are high.  Including the third dimension of line control vs. impersonal controls implies a progression amongst organizations.   As organizations grow in size, they increasingly become structured (moving from a _nascent full bureaucracy_ to a _full bureacracy_).  As organizations increasingly rely on mechanization to produce standardized products, control shifts from workflow personnel to impersonal means, such as processes and new specialists.  Movement along this axis progresses from a _preworkflow bureaucracy_ to a _nascent workflow bureacracu_ and finally to a _workflow bureaucracy_.

## Application
Factor analysis has applications outside of the strictly psychological.
