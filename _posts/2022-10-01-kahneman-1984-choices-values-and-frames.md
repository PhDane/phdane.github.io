Kahneman, D., & Tversky, A. (1984). Choices, values, and frames. American psychologist, 39(4), 341.

## Summary
Risk is defined as knowledge of outcomes, without knowing which outcome will occur.  **Risk aversion** is “a preference for a sure outcome over a gamble that has higher or equal expectation.”  **Risk seeking** is “the rejection of a sure thing in favor of a gamble of lower or equal expectation.”  Citing their own [prospect theory](todo:insert link), the authors show that _loss aversion_ contributes to risk aversion in a positive domain and risk seeking in a negative domain.  The domain refers to the **framing** of an event.  The framing of an event refers to the context in which a decision-maker situates an event.  For example, getting a bonus of $3000 can be viewed as a good thing (in the positive domain), but it could also be viewed in a negative frame (“My bonus is _only_ $3000!  Kim got $5000!”).  When facing a possible loss, people are more likely to seek safety (less likely to go double or nothing when you’re up quite a bit).  When facing a possible gain, people are more likely to seek risk (more likely to go double or nothing when you’re down quite a bit).  Depending on the framing, preferences can be reversed (though outcomes remain the same).  This flies in the face of traditional economics and the traditional theory of consumer behavior.

## Application
Another incredibly powerful heuristic that is rooted in comparison and contrast.  Framing (perhaps through careful control of referents) can change a good situation to bad, or vice versa.  Future research should look at the relationship between anchoring and framing – they seem to be artifacts of the same force (with the main difference being that anchoring seems to be solely qualitative).
