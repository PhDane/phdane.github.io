Kruglanski, A. W. (1996). Motivated Closing of the Mind:" Seizing" and" Freezing'. Psychological Review, 103(2), 263-283.

## Summary
**Need for closure** (for which a valid measure exists) is a trait that reflects an “individuals' desire for a firm answer to a question and an aversion toward ambiguity.”  Need for closure can also be invoked as a state.  Need for specific closure relates to the attractiveness of an answer to a specific question.  Need for nonspecific closure “implies the desirability of any answer as long as it is definite.”  Need for closure encapsulates both the urgency tendency and the permanence tendency.  The _urgency tendency_ reflects the desire to quickly gain closure.  The _permanence tendency_ reflects the desire to maintain closure as long as possible.  Together, these tendencies cause individuals to “seize” and “freeze.”  _Seizing_ refers to the tendency to look for quick answers, which then become resistant to change in a process called “freezing.”  Seizing and freezing are used to explain a number of phenomena, including reducing information processing and increasing confidence in a choice.  The permanence tendency is hypothesized to cause a preference for consensus (because it is unlikely to be challenged) and a preference for generalizable knowledge (as opposed to situation-specific knowledge).  Before the _point of belief crystallization_, need for closure increases the seizing tendency.  After the point of belief crystallization, need for closure increases the freezing tendency.

## Application
High need for closure individuals are apt to jump to conclusions in ambiguous situations.  They’re also less likely to be persuaded to change their opinion.
