## Summary
“Realistic group conflict theory” states that intergroup conflict is caused by conflicting group interests.  Multiple groups are trying to obtain scarce resources, which results in competition.  Competition strengthens morale, cohesiveness, and cooperation.  Intergroup conflict, in addition to creating social conflict, also serves to strengthen the individual’s attachment to their group.  The more intense an intergroup conflict is, the more likely that members will act towards others in their role as group members.  An example of this might be an employee who is continually late to work, but is also friends with their boss.  If that behavior becomes egregious enough, the boss will likely act _as a boss_ and not a friend.

Realistic group conflict theory does not always reflect reality however.  Additional dimensions need to be considered.  **Social mobility** is the process through which a person attains more status by becoming part of a higher-status group.  On the opposite extreme is the belief in **social change**, or the belief that it is extremely difficult for lower-status groups to change their membership to a higher status group.  Groups with a social mobility orientation generally have more mixed membership.  Groups with a social change orientation generally exhibit greater uniformity to their relevant out-group.  **Consensual inferiority** happens when minority out-group members accept that they are actually “second class”  This scenario results in less intergroup conflict.

> “The evidence suggests, however, that where social-structural differences in the distribution of resources have been institutionalized, legitimized, and justified through a consensually accepted status system (or at least a status system that is sufficiently firm and pervasive to prevent the creation of cognitive alternatives to it), the result has been less and not more ethnocentrism in the different status groups."

When outgroup members reject their “previously accepted and consensually negative self-image,” they can start to form a positive group identity.  This situation will create more intergroup conflict between the higher-status in-group and themselves.

Intergroup conflict is caused quite easily.  “The mere awareness of the presence of an out-group” can cause discrimination and competition.  This happens even when group assignment is “explicitly random.”  The authors suggest that intergroup conflict is perhaps “inherent in the intergroup situation itself.”

Groups provide a social reference for individuals and also contribute to one’s **social identity** - “those aspects of an individual’s self-image that derive from the social categories to which he perceives himself as belonging.”  Individuals strive for a positive identity, and group membership either contributes to or detracts from one’s identity.  When positive comparisons can be made to a relevant out-group, the group membership is viewed positively.  If the group is associated negatively, members will try to leave.  To aid in reference comparison, groups seek to differentiate themselves.  They will do this by 1) “comparing the in-group to the out-group on some new dimension,” 2) “changing the values assigned to the attributes of the group, so that comparisons which were previously negative are now perceived as positive,” and 3)  “Changing the out-group (or selecting the out-group) with which the in-group is compared - in particular, ceasing or avoiding to use the high-status out-group as a comparative frame of reference.”  Dominant groups who truly believe they are better generally react to these techniques with discrimination and increased intergroup conflict.

## Application
If there is group conflict within an organization, look at the structures in place that might reduce social mobility.  For example, a company might make the decision to only hire executives with a college degree.  That is something that would reduce social mobility.  Another approach might include finding ways to heighten the status of the out-group.  For example, meet with the group and reaffirm their importance in the organization.
